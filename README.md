Tehran_weather_averages.csv: CSV file with cleaned weather data exported from the Tehran_Weather_Analysis.ipynb.
Analysis Steps
Web Scraping:

Data is scraped from the website using BeautifulSoup.
Information is extracted from HTML tables on the web page.
Data Cleaning:

Data is organized into a pandas DataFrame.
Column names are cleaned, and data types are converted for analysis.
Data Analysis:

Descriptive statistics and a correlation matrix are calculated.
Visualizations are used to provide insights into the data.
Data Visualization:

Heatmap to visualize correlations between temperature and rainy days.
Boxplot to show temperature distribution (Day vs. Night).
Line chart to display yearly temperature patterns.
Bar chart to show annual rainy days.
Data Export:

Cleaned data is saved to a CSV file for reference.
Conclusion
This analysis explores the historical weather data for Tehran, including average daytime and nighttime temperatures, as well as the number of rainy days for each month. The analysis includes data scraping, data cleaning, data visualization, and statistical summaries. Key findings and visualizations are presented to help understand Tehran's weather patterns throughout the year.

Additionally, based on the annual weather averages, it is evident that June and July are particularly appealing months for holidaymakers, as they boast the most favorable weather conditions. During these months, temperatures are pleasant, with an average around 18Â°C, making them ideal for outdoor activities and exploration.
